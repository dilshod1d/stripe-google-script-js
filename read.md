This app serves as an online payment form that allows users to securely submit their personal information and payment details to make a purchase. The payment form includes fields for the user's first name, last name, state, county, date of birth, SOS, SOS address, and gender. It also features a secure credit card input field using Stripe Elements to ensure the card details are handled safely and securely.

When users fill out the form and click the "Pay" button, the app collects their personal information and securely processes their credit card payment using Stripe. The payment details, along with the user's personal information, are then sent to the Google Apps Script backend for further processing. This backend is connected to a Google Sheets document, which can be used to store the transaction information or perform additional tasks, such as sending email notifications or generating invoices.

Overall, this app provides a secure and efficient way to collect payment information and process online transactions using Stripe and Google Apps Script as the backend.
